# CMS PHP
 A CMS been created with PHP  
## PROJECT IS DONE  
DONE IMPORTANT FEATURES:  
- toast message (in tests folder)  
- syncing data with ajax (post author in new posts, online users and ...)  
- rip string function  
- modal approve  

**THINGS THAT COULD BE ADDED FOR MORE FEATURES:**  
- csrf token (for more security, add time and make it more complex with second hashing)  
- old input values function  
- send queries using prepared statements  
- image compressor  


**MAIN REASON I DON'T WORK WITH PHP**  
- NO ROUTING SYSTEM! (.PHP ADD END OF THE ADDRESS)
